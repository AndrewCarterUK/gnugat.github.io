  <p><strong>Deprecated</strong>: Fossil is currently unmaintained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one thing that will make developers use your Free or Open Source Software
(FOSS) project is its documentation. Without it, how can they know what it does,
or how to install it?</p>

<p>Last summer <a href="http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/04/on-open-sourcing-libraries/">William Durand wrote an article about it</a>,
describing the minimum files your FOSS project should have, and what they should
contain.</p>

<p>After reading his article, maybe you did the same thing as me: you took your
courage with both hands and wrote thoroughly a decent documentation for the
project you were working on at the time.</p>

<p>Because it was tedious, you decided to copy those markdown files into your new
projects and adapt them.</p>

<p>But this too was tedious...</p>

<p>To solve this problem once for all I created <strong><a href="https://github.com/gnugat/fossil">fossil</a></strong>:
it will bootstrap the markdown files of your FOSS projects, and it will even
create an installer for you!</p>

<p>It generates the following files out of skeletons:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>CHANGELOG.md</code></li>
<li><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></li>
<li><code>LICENSE</code></li>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>VERSIONING.md</code></li>
<li><code>bin/installer.sh</code></li>
<li><code>doc</code> (or <code>Resources/doc</code> if the project is a bundle) directory:

<ul>
<li><code>01-introduction.md</code></li>
<li><code>02-installation.md</code></li>
<li><code>03-usage.md</code></li>
<li><code>04-tests.md</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The best thing about it: you can run it on your new FOSS projects as well as
with your existing ones! By default it does not replace existing files (if you
want to, simply use the <code>-f</code> option).</p>

<p><strong>Fossil</strong> supports different kind of projects: applications, libraries and
Symfony2 bundles. Here's a quick usage guide.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>The <code>doc</code> command allows you to generate the markdown files of your
applications, which can be a web application or a CLI tool just like <strong>fossil</strong>.</p>

<p>As you can see in the following example, it only requires 2 arguments:</p>

<pre><code>fossil doc 'acme/application' 'The ACME company'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-github-repository-argument">The <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> repository argument</h3>

<p>Applications are installed by cloning the github repository, which makes it as
easy to update as to run <code>git pull</code>.</p>

<p>This argument is used in the installer script as well as in the installation
instructions.</p>

<p>You don't need to write the whole github URL, simply give the username and the
project name in the following format: <code>username/project-name</code></p>

<h3 id="the-license-author-argument">The license author argument</h3>

<p>While the copyright's date can be computed, you need to provide the author's
name to generate the <code>LICENSE</code> file.</p>

<p>For now it only generates MIT licenses, but pull requests are welcomed :) .</p>

<h3 id="the-path-option">The path option</h3>

<p>By default the files are created in the current directory, but you can target a
specific path:</p>

<pre><code>fossil doc 'acme/application' 'The ACME company' -p '/tmp/application'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-force-overwrite-option">The force overwrite option</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, <strong>fossil</strong> won't replace existing files by default: for
instance if your project already has a <code>README.md</code> and a <code>LICENSE</code> file it will
only generate the other ones.</p>

<p>But if you want to throw them away, you can use this option:</p>

<pre><code>fossil doc 'acme/project' 'The ACME company' -f
</code></pre>

<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>

<p>The <code>doc:library</code> command has the exact same arguments and options as the <code>doc</code>
one:</p>

<pre><code>fossil doc:library 'acme/library' 'The ACME company'
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the shortcut <code>d:l</code>:</p>

<pre><code>fossil d:l 'acme/library' 'The ACME company'
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between an application and a library lies in its installation:
the library is installed using <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-composer-package-option">The composer package option</h3>

<p>By default <strong>fossil</strong> assumes the composer package's name is the same as the
Github repository name (in the example it would be <code>acme/library</code>).
If it's not your case, use the following option:</p>

<pre><code>fossil d:l 'acme/library' 'The ACME company' -c 'acme/composer-package'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="symfony2-bundles">Symfony2 Bundles</h2>

<p>The <code>doc:bundle</code> command has almost the same arguments and options as the
<code>doc:library</code> one. It has an additional argument:</p>

<pre><code>fossil doc:bundle 'acme/demo-bundle' 'The ACME company' 'Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle'
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the shortcut <code>d:b</code>:</p>

<pre><code>fossil d:b 'acme/demo-bundle' 'The ACME company' 'Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle'
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between a library and a bundle is the documentation directory,
which is in <code>Resources/doc</code> instead of <code>doc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-fully-qualified-classname-argument">The fully qualified classname argument</h3>

<p>Another difference is the installation: the bundle needs to be added in the
application's kernel.</p>

<p>This will be detailed in the documentation, but it will also be taken care of
by the installer.</p>

<p>That's right, you read it right: when developers will run the installer, not
only will it download the bundle using composer, but it will also add its fully
qualified classname in the <code>app/AppKernel.php</code> file! Hooray!</p>

<p>The application's kernel will look like this afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// File: app/AppKernel.php

use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel;

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // Other bundles...
            new Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle(),
        );

        if (in_array($this-&gt;getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test'))) {
            // Other bundles...
        }

        return $bundles;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: because of the backslashes you should escape this argument using
quotes, just like in the example.</p>

<h3 id="the-development-tool-option">The development tool option</h3>

<p>By using this option, the bundle will be registered in the application only if
it runs in development or test environment:</p>

<pre><code>fossil d:b 'acme/demo-bundle' 'The ACME company' 'Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle' -d
</code></pre>

<p>The application's kernel will look like this afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// File: app/AppKernel.php

use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel;

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // Other bundles...
        );

        if (in_array($this-&gt;getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test'))) {
            // Other bundles...
            $bundles[] = new Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle();
        }

        return $bundles;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="you-still-need-to-write-the-documentation">You still need to write the documentation</h2>

<p>After running <strong>fossil</strong> you still need to provide some information (for
instance the elevator pitch in <code>README.md</code>) by editing those files:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>doc/01-introduction.md</code></li>
<li><code>doc/03-usage.md</code></li>
<li><code>doc/04-tests.md</code></li>
</ul>

<p>But is that enough? While I think <strong>fossil</strong> automates as much things as
possible, there's still some part of your project that needs specific
documentation.</p>

<p>For example you could add recipes which describe common tasks, or a glossary
defining technical or business terms used in your project.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Bootstrap the markdown files of your new and your old FOSS projects using
<strong><a href="https://github.com/gnugat/fossil">fossil</a></strong>, and then complete the
documentation so everyone can see how awesome your work is!</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As a curious person I'm constantly trying to learn new practices and to discover
tools which might help me, by collecting information via technology scouting and
then reading it.</p>

<p>In this article, I will present how to do so effectively.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-information">Collecting information</h2>

<p>Whenever you find an interesting link, send it to <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>
so you can read it later.</p>

<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>

<p>To find interesting links subscribe to blog RSS feeds using
<a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a>: it will send new entries directly to
pocket.</p>

<p>Here are some blogs I personnally follow (caution, they're not really sorted):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://williamdurand.fr/">William Durand's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog">Mountain Goat Software</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.karolsojko.com/">Karol Sójko's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/">8th light</a></li>
<li><a href="http://richardmiller.co.uk/">Richard Miller's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://verraes.net/#blog">Mathias Verraes's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.whitewashing.de/">Benjamin Eberlei's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nedroid.com/">Nedroid</a></li>
<li><a href="https://igor.io/">Igor Wiedler's blog</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>

<p>You can also use <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a private list which will serve as a pool</li>
<li>add any author which might post interresting messages</li>
<li>after a week or so, add the author to a public list</li>
</ol>

<p>The lists only show messages (not retweets) and conversations between people
you follow. They also allow you to create categories.</p>

<p>If you want, you can have a look at
<a href="https://twitter.com/epiloic/lists/">my own public lists</a>.</p>

<h3 id="github">Github</h3>

<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> can also be a great source of
discoveries: by following someone which stars or watch a lot of projects you
will have them listed on your homepage.</p>

<p>Here's my advice: <a href="https://github.com/pborreli">Pascal Borreli</a> contributes to
many repositories, you should start to follow him.</p>

<h2 id="reading-it">Reading it</h2>

<p>Collecting resources is a thing, getting it read is another one. Just like
<a href="http://verraes.net/2012/12/how-to-read-more-books/">Mathias Verraes advised it</a>,
you should get an e-reader: you can send the pages you gathered on Pocket and
then read them everywhere.</p>

<p>Pocket allows you to remove the articles you found not so interresting after
all, it also allows you to archive the good ones and to favorite the great ones.</p>

<p>Speaking of reading and e-readers, books are another good way of discovering new
things. Do not underestimate them. Here's a list of books I'd recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git</a></li>
<li>Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin</li>
<li>Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, by Robert C. Martin</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The point is: current tools won't last and there's a lot of practices you're
not aware of. If you want to improve yourself and keep up with other developers,
you have to try your best to discover new practices (which might be rather old
actually) and new trending tools.</p>

<p>I hope you found this article enjoyable and helpful.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Frameworks are a real help when building web applications which serve business
logic. But what about static websites?</p>

<p>Those only contain pages which could be directly written in HTML. The only
problem with this approach is that HTML isn't writter friendly compared to
Markdown.</p>

<p>Also, we could say that static websites like blogs do have some logic behind the
scenes:</p>

<ul>
<li>posts can have a state (is it published yet?)</li>
<li>posts can be tagged, in order to make them easier to find</li>
</ul>

<p>But still, a framework might be too much for this task.</p>

<p>Static site generators are a way to solve this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>simply write your pages in markdown</li>
<li>launch a command to generate HTML from it</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://carew.github.io/">Carew</a> is one of them (among
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
  <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/obensonne/poole">Poole</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/spjwebster/lanyon">Lanyon</a>):
it is written in PHP, allows you to use the template engine
<a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> in your markdown and it provides a theme
using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>This blog post will focus on Carew, as
<a href="https://github.com/gnugat/gnugat.github.io">this very blog is written with it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="carew-and-github">Carew and Github</h2>

<p>A common way to quickly publish static sites is to use
<a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which works as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a repository, the name should follow this format: <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code></li>
<li>add, commit and push the content of the <code>web</code> directory directly at the
root of your repo</li>
<li>the site is now available at this address: <code>http://&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://carew.github.io/cookbook/hosting.html">Learn more about hosting a website built with Carew on the official website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>

<p>Creating your site using Carew is very simple, just follow these steps:</p>

<pre><code>$ php composer.phar create-project carew/boilerplate &lt;project&gt; -s dev
$ cd &lt;project&gt;
$ bin/carew build
</code></pre>

<p>Examples pages (which sources are located in <code>pages</code> and <code>posts</code>) are converted
from markdown to HTML in the <code>web</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>

<p>Before writing any page or post, edit the configuration wich is located inside
the <code>config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>Then edit the <code>pages/index.md</code> and <code>pages/about.md</code> pages with your own content.</p>

<p>Finally, remove the content of the <code>posts</code> folder and create your first blog
post using this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/carew generate:post [--date='YYYY-MM-DD'] title
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://carew.github.io/cookbook/configuration.html">See the configuration documentation on the official website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="front-matters">Front matters</h2>

<p>Each markdown file starts with a header:</p>

<pre><code>---
layout: post # no need for this line when writing a regular page
title: Will be used by `&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;` and `&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;`
tags:
    - first tag
    - carew
---
</code></pre>

<p>Carew generates a page listing all existing tags. You can create a link to this
page with the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>{{ link('tags', 'The page with all the tags') }}.
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://carew.github.io/documentation.html#front-matter">Learn more about Front matters on the official website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Carew is really simple to use, in this article we've covered the minimum you
should know to create pages, blog posts and tags.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this article and that it helped you a little.</p>
