And here's the books I'd like to read: [my wish list](http://amzn.com/w/39ZFHHUADC8QU).

## Extending Symfony 2 Web Application Framework - Sebastien Armand

An overview of the [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) framework extension points:
services, listeners, form types, etc, full of real life examples.

Overall, I've found it more usefull for developers who start with the framework,
by I'd still advise it.

## A year with Symfony - Matthias Noback

An easy to read book about how the [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) framework
works behind the scene, and with many advices on how to structure your
application.

I'd advise it to beginners as well to advanced developers: it's not one of those
"printed copy of the documentation". The only downsides to me were the chapters
on the configuration (because I'm not interrested) and on the security (I
expected explanations on the Security Component, but it is instead some general
security wise tips).

## HTML5: Up and Running - Mark Pilgrim

A more than complete book about HTML5, I've appreciated the contextualization:
how HTML5 was created and what are the problems addressed by each features.
It also talks of thing which are related to HTML5 but aren't included in it.

I've found the explanations about encoding (for videos and sounds) a bit
overdone and I had a hard time to get interested by micro data. I guess you
should pick only the things you'll be working with.

## Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture - Martin Fowler

When speaking about patterns with colleagues, it's often easier to use the same
vocabulary. This book gives you the names, the definitions and the usages for
many of them.

To me it's more an encyclopedia than a book.

## Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming - Marijn Haverbeke

The funniest programming book I've read so far! If you thought you knew
javascript, you should read this book. The basics and advanced stuff are
presented with exercises, allowing you to assimilate anything.

Unfortunately this book is aging fast: it's using ECMAScript version 3, and many
helpers function created in the book have been integrated in the core language
now... But still, it's not obsolete yet.

## Git pro - Scott Chacon

Explains everything about git. Experts and newbies can and should read this
book!

There's a big missing part though: rebasing. And I didn't took any interest in
how to set up my own git repository server.

## Clean Code - Robert C. Martin

I'm very fond of uncle bob's books: they're clear, simple and full of best
practices explained with plenty of code.

In this one, the only thing which didn't get me interested was the part on multi
threads, but it's only a small part of the book.

It contains:

* definitions (yep, plural) of clean code
* some generic rules
* an index of smells (things hinting that you should clean your code)

If I could sum up the book, I'd say: make a coding standard with your team, and
stick to it.

## Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices - Robert C. Martin

I've really liked this book, as it presents many interresting principles with
concrete examples.

It contains:

* explanations about agile and eXtreme Programming methodologies
* design patterns
* design principles
* packaging principles
