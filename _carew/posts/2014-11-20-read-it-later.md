We often find interesting links on the web, but don't have time to read them
immediately. This article will describe how to efficiently manage them so we can
read them later.

## Pocket

We all have different strategies to "bookmark" links: actually bookmark them,
favorite a tweet, subscribing to a RSS feed... The problem arises when we do all
of those: wouldn't it be nice to have a single place to read them all?

We could use our emails for this: we check them often, we can archive them,
favorite them or delete them. [Inbox](http://www.google.com/inbox/) from Google
makes the task even easier: we can snooze an email so it only appears at a given
time, or a given location.

The problem is that it mixes "bookmarks" and "notifications": we could
accidently ignore a business email by mistaking it with a "bookmark".

But don't panic! There's an application for this: [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/)
(formerly "Read it later").
The advantage of Pocket is that you can install an extension in your browser so
you can save a link or a tweet, and there's a mobile application which works
offline, so you can read in the subway if you want.

## If "this", then "that"

The Pocket extension allows us to save manually links, but what about RSS feeds?
What if we're used to favorite tweets (habits die hard)?

Well there's an application for this: [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com/).
Basically you can select one of the (many) supported triggers (RSS feed, tweet
favoriting and others), then select one of the (many) supported actions (save to
pocket, send an email and others).

> **Note**: I can't seem to be able to find the "Twitter list has new tweets"
> trigger. But there's a "Someone tweets" trigger, so we can compose with it.

## Conclusion

You don't have to reinvent the wheel: all the tools are here! They're free of
charge and they follow the philosophy "do one thing and do it well".
