As a curious person I'm constantly trying to learn new practices and to discover
tools which might help me, by collecting information via technology scouting and
then reading it.

In this article, I will present how to do so effectively.

## Collecting information

Whenever you find an interesting link, send it to [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/)
so you can read it later.

### Blogs

To find interesting links subscribe to blog RSS feeds using
[If This Then That](https://ifttt.com/): it will send new entries directly to
pocket.

Here are some blogs I personnally follow (caution, they're not really sorted):

* [William Durand's blog](http://williamdurand.fr/)
* [Mountain Goat Software](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog)
* [Karol SÃ³jko's blog](http://blog.karolsojko.com/)
* [8th light](http://blog.8thlight.com/)
* [Richard Miller's blog](http://richardmiller.co.uk/)
* [Mathias Verraes's blog](http://verraes.net/#blog)
* [Benjamin Eberlei's blog](http://www.whitewashing.de/)
* [Nedroid](http://nedroid.com/)
* [Igor Wiedler's blog](https://igor.io/)

### Twitter

You can also use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/):

1. create a private list which will serve as a pool
2. add any author which might post interresting messages
3. after a week or so, add the author to a public list

The lists only show messages (not retweets) and conversations between people
you follow. They also allow you to create categories.

If you want, you can have a look at
[my own public lists](https://twitter.com/epiloic/lists/).

### Github

Last but not least, [Github](https://github.com/) can also be a great source of
discoveries: by following someone which stars or watch a lot of projects you
will have them listed on your homepage.

Here's my advice: [Pascal Borreli](https://github.com/pborreli) contributes to
many repositories, you should start to follow him.

## Reading it

Collecting resources is a thing, getting it read is another one. Just like
[Mathias Verraes advised it](http://verraes.net/2012/12/how-to-read-more-books/),
you should get an e-reader: you can send the pages you gathered on Pocket and
then read them everywhere.

Pocket allows you to remove the articles you found not so interresting after
all, it also allows you to archive the good ones and to favorite the great ones.

Speaking of reading and e-readers, books are another good way of discovering new
things. Do not underestimate them. Here's a list of books I'd recommend:

* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)
* Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin
* Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, by Robert C. Martin

## Conclusion

The point is: current tools won't last and there's a lot of practices you're
not aware of. If you want to improve yourself and keep up with other developers,
you have to try your best to discover new practices (which might be rather old
actually) and new trending tools.

I hope you found this article enjoyable and helpful.
