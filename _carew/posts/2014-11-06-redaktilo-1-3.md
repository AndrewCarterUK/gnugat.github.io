{{ link('posts/2014-05-09-redaktilo.md', 'Six months ago') }}, I talked about a
[silly library](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo) I was working on.

I've just released it's version 1.3, so I figured that maybe it's time to talk
about it as the mature and usefull project it has become.

## Statistics

First, here's some meaningless figures:

* fisrt commit: at 08:06:46, on the 24th thursday of April 2014
* number of releases: 36 (including 11 stable ones)
* number of contributors: 3 ([Loick Piera](http://loickpiera.com/), [WouterJ](http://wouterj.nl/) and myself)
* lines of code (according to [Insight, for version 1.3.0](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/fbe2d89f-f64d-45c2-a680-bbafac4b0d08/analyses/36)): 1 183

## History

In my two previous pet projects (GnugatWizardBundle and Fossil), as well as in
professional projects, I've encountered the need to manipulate lines (from a
file or a static string).

I've done 3 different implementations, each less reusable than the other, so I
started to think that there was something to do here.

That's how [Redaktilo](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo) is born!

## Public API

My purpose was to create a single service which would be used as a text editor
("redaktilo" means "editor", in esperanto):

```php
<?php

namespace Gnugat\Redaktilo;

class Editor
{
    // Filesystem operations:
    public function open($filename, $force = false);
    public function save(File $file);

    // Line selection
    public function jumpAbove(Text $text, $pattern, $location = null);
    public function jumpBelow(Text $text, $pattern, $location = null);

    // Line detection
    public function hasAbove(Text $text, $pattern, $location = null);
    public function hasBelow(Text $text, $pattern, $location = null);

    // Line manipulations
    public function insertAbove(Text $text, $addition, $location = null);
    public function insertBelow(Text $text, $addition, $location = null);
    public function replace(Text $text, $replacement, $location = null);
    public function replaceAll(Text $text, $pattern, $replacement);
    public function remove(Text $text, $location = null);

    // You can execute custom commands!
    public function run($name, array $input);
}
```

This service is **stateless**, it manipulates the following model:

```php
<?php

namespace Gnugat\Redaktilo;

class Text
{
    public function getLines();
    public function setLines(array $lines);
    public function getLength();

    public function getLineBreak();
    public function setLineBreak($lineBreak);

    public function getCurrentLineNumber();
    public function setCurrentLineNumber($lineNumber);
    public function getLine($lineNumber = null);
    public function setLine($line, $lineNumber = null);
}
```

> **Note**: The `File` model extends `Text` and adds `filename` getter and
> setter.

As you can see, everything is centered around a current line, but specifying
directly a line number is possible (that's the meaning of the `$location`
argument).

## Facade and extension points

To be honest, `Editor` doesn't do anything, it just wraps some low level
services. Amongst those, we have:

* `SearchEngine`: decides which `SearchStrategy` will be used
* `CommandInvoker`: executes a `Command`

Those two are actually here to provide extension points: if you need to look for
a line with something else than a regular expression, you can create your own
`SearchStrategy`, register it in `SearchEngine` and it will be available
directly from the `Editor`!

If the manipulations provided out of the box aren't sufficient, you can create
your own `Command`, register it in `CommandInvoker` and it will be available
directly from the `Editor`!

Commands rely on user input, which is why Loïck worked on `InputSanitizer` to
validate it. If the ones provided aren't enough, you can still create your own
implementations.

Finally, I'd like to highlight Wouter's work on the `EditorFatory` helper: it is
really cumbersome to instantiate manually `Editor`... But thanks to this
factory, you'll never have to do it by yourself!

> **Note**: Working on a [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) project? You can use
> [RedaktiloBundle](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo-bundle), which also
> provides tags to register custom search strategies and commands.

## What's next?

Loïck is currently improving the library's exceptions for the version 1.4.

For version 1.5, two new methods will be added to `Text`:
`incrementCurrentLineNumber` and `decrementCurrentLineNumber`, to avoid the
following:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Gnugat\Redaktilo\EditorFactory;

$editor = EditorFactory::createEditor();
$file = $editor->open('/tmp/monty-python.txt');

// Currently
$currentLineNumber = $file->getCurrentLineNumber();
$file->setCurrentLineNumber($currentLineNumber + 2);

// Soon...
$file->incrementCurrentLineNumber(2);
```

For the final version 1.6, a strong documentation of the deprecations will be
done, leading the way to version 2.0 where those will be removed (50% of the code
base will vanish!).

> **Note**: As I'm using Redaktilo everyday, I might discover new improvements
> to be done, leading the given version numbers above to change.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it a GUI / CLI tool?

A question I've been often asked, because describing Redaktilo as a text editor
might be a bit misleading. It is a library which **feels like** an editor, but
it is in no way an actual editor you might run.

Here's an example of what you might be doing currently without Redaktilo:

```php
<?php

$lines = file('/tmp/monty-python.txt');
$currentLineNumber = 42;
$section = array_slice($lines, 0, $current, true); // Lines from 0 to 42
$reversedSection = array_reverse($section, true);
$found = preg_grep('/a knewt/', $reversedSection); // finding the first occurence, above line 42
$currentLineNumber = key($found);

array_splice($lines, $currentLineNumber + 1, 0, 'new line below "a knewt"');
$content = implode("\n", $lines); // Let's hope it wasn't a file created on Windows.
file_put_contents($content, '/tmp/monty-python');
```

With redaktilo:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Gnugat\Redaktilo\EditorFactory;

$editor = EditorFactory::createEditor();
$file = $editor->open('/tmp/monty-python');
$editor->jumpAbove($file, '/a knewt/', 42);
$editor->insertBelow($file, 'new line below "a knewt"');
$editor->save($file);
```

### Is it a code editor?

Because the code example on the README is about inserting a new line in the
`AppKernel` file of a Symfony2 application, I also get this question.

Redaktilo can edit any text file, so it includes source files. But keep in mind
that it only manipulates lines, when you might want to manipulate an AST to edit
code.

I'm working on a new silly project: [Medio](https://github.com/gnugat/medio).
It heavily relies on Redaktilo to actually edit code: so you can make a code
editor with it, but again before you start ask yourself if an AST wouldn't be
better.

## Conclusion

Redaktilo is a library which makes line manipulation dead easy! It provides
extension points and will soon reach version 2 which will mark its final
maturity point.

Until then, you can still use it safely, it's been stable for 11 releases now.
