[TL;DR: jump to the conclusion](#conclusion).

Since the announcement of [Redaktilo](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo) on
this blog, this silly library has jumped from 164 lines of code in v0.3 to 571
in v0.7.

In this article:

1. we'll quickly oversee [the changes done](#changes-done)
2. then we'll have some insight on [the upcoming changes](#upcoming-changes)
3. finally I'll list [the remaining unresolved questions](#remaining-unresolved-questions)

## Changes done

Thanks to [WouterJ](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/commits?author=WouterJ)
you can now:

* remove the current line: `$editor->remove($file);`
* replace the current line: `$editor->changeTo($file, $replacement);`
* replace all occurences: `$editor->replaceWith($file, $regex, $callback);`
* check line presence: `$editor->has($file, $pattern);`

I've updated to documentation to make the library easier to learn with:

* a [tutorial](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/blob/master/doc/01-tutorial.md)
* a [code reference](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/blob/master/doc/03-reference.md)

**Redaktilo** has been created to fulfill actual needs. To make sure it keeps
this promise, I've added executable
[examples using PHPUnit tests](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/master/tests/example).

The major changes have been massive refactorings to allow the library to be
extended:

* [you can add search strategies](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/master/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo/Search)
* [you can convert the file's content](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/master/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo/Converter)

As highlited by [Clément Herreman](https://twitter.com/clemherreman/status/466497340824911872),
those refactorings have introduced a more complex construction schema.
To make things easier, a
[static Dependency Injection Container](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/blob/master/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo/DependencyInjection/StaticContainer.php)
has been created.

## Upcoming changes

[Sublime Text's go to anything](http://www.sublimetext.com/) feature is
really awesome, which is why I'd like to implement something similar:

* go to the previous/next line (`array_search`)
* go to x lines above/under
* go to the previous/next substring match (`strpos`)
* go to the previous/next regex match (`preg_grep`)
* go to the previous/next PHP class/method/function (`token_get_all`)

The two first ones are already available, so the other one still have to be
implemented (the last one might be done by
[Loick Piera](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/issues/6#issuecomment-44005931)).

The methods allowing this throw exception when nothing is found. Adding a
relative check (`hasBefore` and `hasAfter`) might make things easier.

Moving relatively isn't always sufficient. To go to an absolute line number
you have to use directly `File`, maybe it would be nicer to add a new method
to `Editor` (`jumpToFirst`).

Finally, the editor should allow insertion, replacement and removal in any
locations, not just on the current line.

Once these features added, more refactoring should take place: since the
creation of **Redaktilo**, [Jean-François Simon](https://github.com/jfsimon)
advised me to use the command and memento patterns, which would allow the
undo/redo feature.
While I now think that `Command` is indeed more suitable than `ReplaceStrategy`
for insertion, replacement and removal, I'm not sure the versioning feature
is actually needed... For now.

And that should bring us near an alpha version :) .

A lot of renaming should happen at this stage:

* `changeTo` to `replace`
* `replaceWith` to `replaceAll`
* `NotSupportedException` to `NotFoundEsception`

And perhaps some other methods or class names.

Once the heavy renaming done, beta versions can begin, with a main focus on
making every thing safer (argument checking, exception handling).

## Remaining unresolved questions

I'm still not fully sure of what Redaktilo v1.0 will look like. Mainly because
I still haven't anwsered this by question (which have been in my mind since the
begining):

Should **Redaktilo** handle different kinds of files?

Sometimes I think it should, which is why the project has seen:

* [Editor interface](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/v0.1.0/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo/Editor)
* [File interface](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/v0.1.0/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo/File)
* [a premature ReplaceEngine/ReploaceStrategy](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/v0.6.1/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo)
* [ContentConverter interface](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo/tree/v0.7.0/src/Gnugat/Redaktilo/Converter)

The motives behind this is the JSON use case: you can currently edit JSON
files, but it's tedious.

Let's take the `composer.json` example. What if you need to
[add a script](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md) when:

* there's no `scripts` section yet?
* there's no subsection in `script` yet?
* there's already a script, but not in an array
* there's already some scripts

Another example would be the addition of a new element in an array: you
currently have to manually a trailing comma to the previous entry...

## Conclusion

**Redaktilo** fulfills 98% of my use cases (inserting new lines in a YAML
configuration file, editing PHP files and replacing bits in a documentation
file) and is now extensible.

Some search strategies will be added to make it similar to the
[Sublime Text's go to anything](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and some
refactoring are still necessary before an alpha version.

There's still some unresolved questions (JSON edition is the 2% use case left),
but I'm sure they'll be answered during the development.

In the end `Editor` should have the following methods (no guaranty on the
names):

* filesystem operations: open/save
* checking line presence: has/hasBefore/hasAfter
* content navigation: jumpTo/jumpUpTo/jumpDownTo
* content manipulation: insert/remove/replace (on the current line or at the
  given location)
* global manipulation: replaceAll

Any help is appreciated, whether it's some code review, typo fixing or
code/documentation contribution. But the biggest help you could give me:
provide me with some feedback on Redaktilo's usage :) .
