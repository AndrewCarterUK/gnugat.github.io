[Couscous](http://couscous.io) is a static site generator tool for your Github projects,
converting all markdown files into an online documentation hosted by
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Installation

The first step is to get the tool:

```
curl -OS http://couscous.io/couscous.phar
sudo mv ./couscous.phar /usr/loal/bin/couscous
```

Then we need to create a `couscous.yml` file at the root of our Github Project:

```
template:
    url: https://github.com/CouscousPHP/Template-Light.git

baseUrl: http://<user-name>.github.io/<project-name>

title: <project-title>
subTitle: <project-short-decription>

github:
    user: <user-name>
    repo: <project-name>

menu:
    items:
        home:
            text: Home
            relativeUrl:

        <article-name>:
            text: <article-title>
            relativeUrl: <article-filename>.html
```

Of course `<user-name>`, `<project-name>`, `<project-title>`, `<project-short-decription>`,
`<article-name>`, `article-title` and `article-filename` need to be replaced accordingly.

## Generating the Documentation

Couscous is going to automatically use `*.md` files found in the project (e.g. `README.md`).

The `menu` section in `couscous.yml` will generate a handy menu. Usually `home`
as well as the rest of the documentation is listed here, for example:

```
menu:
    items:
        home:
            text: Home
            relativeUrl:

        installation:
            text: Installation
            relativeUrl: doc/01-installation.html

        compatibility:
            text: Compatibility
            relativeUrl: doc/02-compatibility.html

        benchmark:
            text: Benchmark
            relativeUrl: doc/03-benchmark.html
```

To generate the documentation, simply run:

    couscous preview

This will launch a local server, allowing us to preview the documentation at `http://localhost:8000`.

Once satisfied, we can run:

    couscous deploy

This will generate the definitive HTML, commit them in a `gh-page` branch and push
it, making it available online.

## Conclusion

Couscous provides the possibility to host nice documentation for Github projects,
thanks to its simplicity.
